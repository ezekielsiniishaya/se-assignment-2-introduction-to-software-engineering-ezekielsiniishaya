    When you want to build a close relationship with your customers.

When to Choose Waterfall:
    When you're working on a project with well-defined requirements and fixed deadlines.
    When there’s little room for change or experimentation.
    When you need a clear roadmap from start to finish.
    When you’re working on a small project with a limited budget and scope.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

# Answer:

Requirement Engineering is a process used in software development that involves gathering and analyzing information about the software you want to build. It’s about figuring out what the software needs to do, who will use it, and how it will be used.
Requirement Engineering is a process in software development that involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, prioritizing, and managing software requirements. Its importance lies in ensuring that the final product meets the needs of its users, reduces misunderstandings, and minimizes the risk of costly errors during development.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

# Answer:

Modularity is a concept in software design that involves breaking down a large software system into smaller, self-contained units or modules. Each module performs a specific task or has a specific function, and can be developed and tested independently.

Modularity improves the maintainability and scalability of software systems in a few ways:
    Easier to Maintain: When a system is modular, it's easier for developers to find and fix problems, because each module is responsible for a specific task. This also makes it easier to update a system, because you can change or replace individual modules without affecting the rest of the system.
    Easier to Scale: Modular systems are easier to scale up or down, because you can add or remove modules as needed.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

# Answer:

Unit Testing: Testing individual units or components of a software system, such as functions, classes, or methods.
Integration Testing: Testing how different parts of a system work together, usually after unit testing is complete.
System Testing: Testing an entire system to ensure it meets its specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Testing whether a system meets the needs and expectations of its end users.

Testing is crucial in software development for several reasons: Testing helps to identify bugs, defects, and errors in the software, which can be fixed before the product is released. This improves the overall quality of the product and reduces the chances of problems arising after launch. Testing helps ensure that the software functions as intended and is reliable under different conditions. This helps to build trust and confidence in the product among users.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

# Answer:

Version control systems, also known as revision control or source control systems, are software tools that help software developers and other team members to manage changes to source code and other types of digital documents. They keep a record of all changes made to files, allowing team members to easily track changes, revert to previous versions if necessary, and collaborate on projects more effectively.

Examples:
Git: An open-source, distributed version control system, known for its speed and flexibility. It allows for easy branching, merging, and reverting to previous versions of files. It’s widely used in open-source projects, such as Linux and Android.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized version control system that stores all its data in a central repository. It offers features like version histories, locking and branching.
CVS: One of the oldest version control systems, still in use in some companies.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

# Answer:

 A software project manager act as the link between different stakeholders in the software development process, from clients and management to the development team. They need to have a clear vision for the project, set realistic goals, and keep everything organized and on schedule.

The key responsibilities of a software project manager include:
    Planning: Establishing clear goals and deadlines, creating a project schedule, and assigning tasks to team members.
    Budgeting: Allocating resources and ensuring the project stays within budget.
    Managing: Coordinating team members, monitoring progress, and making decisions.
